# textSavePractice
I'm trying to learn how the input/output files work. In these files I have my ConsoleApplication3 which gathers the names of 3 users and assigns them their ids. This data is then saved in a text file and read in my other program ConsoleApplication2. What I need help with  is keeping the formatting intact. I could hard code the same formatting as ConsoleApplication3 but if there is a way to keep the old formatting without doing so please let me know and if there is a way to fix the formatting so that they are aligned would also help me out.
